## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS/SCSS
- JavaScript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

During the creation of this project, I learned the basics of React and hooks. It was difficult for me to destructure the code due to the data structure that was provided in the challenge. I did not find a good solution for managing the comment replies functionality, so I had to almost completely duplicate the comment component and reply component with modifications for replies. In this challenge, I focused more on logic and paid less attention to semantics and accessibility. 

### Continued development

In the next challenges, I will improve my skills in writing a React application and pay more attention to semantics and accessibility for users. I'm also interested in Redux.
